# Rethinking “Good Price” – Toward Fair and Balanced Criteria

This project presents a strategic proposal to improve the selection criteria of **“Good Price”** program.  
It recommends moving beyond a **price-focused evaluation** and adopting a **more balanced and rational standard** for recognizing truly affordable and high-quality establishments.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Current selection criteria for “Good Price” restaurants tend to overemphasize low prices, sometimes at the cost of quality and sustainability.  
This project introduces a **data-driven framework** that evaluates stores not only on price, but also on factors such as:
- Sales growth trends  
- Store sustainability  
- Regional market dynamics  
- Balanced affordability  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Propose a **strategic redesign** of the Good Price designation process
- Visualize and classify stores using **interactive Mapbox choropleth maps**
- Develop an **evaluation index** that reflects both affordability and business soundness
- Support **policy improvement** through data-backed insights

## 📊 Data Sources
The project uses administrative data covering:
- Quarterly sales (2022–2024)
- Number of active food service stores
- Store types and regional codes
- Geospatial boundary data (shapefiles)

---

## 🗺️ Visualization
We use `MapboxGL` and `GeoPandas` to provide:
- Class-based choropleth maps by region
- 3D map height representations based on combined growth indicators
- Interactive filters for focused analysis on different business environments

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python (pandas, geopandas, scikit-learn, prophet, matplotlib)
- MapboxGL
- Jupyter Notebooks & Streamlit (optional frontend)
- GeoJSON / Shapefile preprocessing
