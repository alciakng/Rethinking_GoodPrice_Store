# Rethinking “Good Price” – A Data-Driven Top-Down Strategy for Local Affordability Policy

This project aims to enhance the **strategic execution of the Good Price Store program** by South Korea’s Ministry of the Interior and Safety.  
By leveraging **regional commercial characteristics** and **unsupervised machine learning clustering**, we analyze affordability trends and propose a **data-driven, top-down policy approach** to support effective designation and activation of Good Price policies.

## 🔍 Project Purpose

Current selection methods often rely on static price levels and lack spatial-economic context.  
This project introduces a **systematic clustering approach** that:

- Uses **objective market features** to group regions with similar affordability and commercial patterns  
- Recommends **tailored strategies per cluster type**  
- Promotes **top-down, region-sensitive planning** by local governments

## 🔬 Analytical Pipeline

The project is structured in four stages:

1. **Regression Analysis**  
   Identify and verify the **determinants of Good Price store presence** using panel regression models.

2. **SPC (Supervised Principal Component) Analysis**  
   Reduce feature redundancy and extract **principal components most predictive of policy outcomes**.

3. **Clustering by Principal Components**  
   Segment local markets via unsupervised clustering (KMeans, Hierarchical) based on SPC outputs.

4. **Cluster-Based Strategic Policy Recommendations**  
   Propose distinct **strategic directions for each region type** to support top-down planning.

## 📊 Data Overview

The dataset integrates administrative and geospatial information spanning **2020–2024**, including:

- Quarterly store-level panel data  
- **Floating population** (`유동인구수`)  
- **Workplace population** (`직장인구수`)  
- **Resident population** (`상주인구수`)  
- **Number of commercial complexes** (`집객시설수`)  
- **Apartment complex count and average market price** (`아파트 단지수 및 평균 시가`)  
- **Business turnover indicators** (`개업률`, `폐업률`)  
- **Commercial zone change index** (`상권변화지표`)  
- **20s–30s population ratio** (`20~30 인구비`)  

All data is merged based on **official administrative codes** and **shapefile-based boundaries**.
